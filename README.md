Goodreads Sign-In Clone
This is a pixel-perfect clone of the Goodreads Sign-In page. The project demonstrates my front-end development skills, focusing on creating responsive layouts, interactive elements, and integrating mood-based book suggestions.

Features
Mood-based Book Suggestions: Click on different mood icons (e.g., curious, romantic, adventurous, etc.), and the page suggests a book based on the selected mood.

Responsive Design: The page is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly for the hackathon purposes.

Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the page.

CSS: For styling the page, including layout, colors, and typography.

JavaScript: For the interactivity, including mood-based book suggestions and the clickable map feature.

How It Works
Mood-based Book Suggestions:

There are several mood icons (like üòÅ, üßê, üò°, etc.) displayed on the page. When a user clicks on any of these icons, the page shows a book suggestion that aligns with that mood.

Books include popular titles like "Sapiens" for the curious mood or "Pride and Prejudice" for the romantic mood.

Future Enhancements
Add dynamic book data from an API (like the Goodreads API) instead of hardcoding book information.

Improve accessibility (e.g., adding ARIA roles and ensuring keyboard navigation).

Optimize performance for faster load times on mobile devices.
